Here we can understand cloudformation when we create eks cluster


AWS CloudFormation plays a crucial role in managing Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) by providing infrastructure as code capabilities. Hereâ€™s how CloudFormation is used in the context of EKS:

### 1. **Cluster Creation and Management**

- **Infrastructure Automation**: AWS CloudFormation can automate the creation of EKS clusters. You can define the entire infrastructure for your EKS cluster, including the VPC, subnets, security groups, IAM roles, and the EKS cluster itself in a CloudFormation template.
- **Repeatable Deployments**: Using CloudFormation templates ensures that you can consistently create and configure EKS clusters in different environments (development, testing, production) with the same configuration.
- **Version Control**: CloudFormation templates can be stored in version control systems like Git. This allows you to track changes, review history, and collaborate with others on infrastructure changes.

### 2. **Node Group Management**

- **Managed Node Groups**: CloudFormation can be used to define and manage EKS managed node groups. This includes specifying the instance types, AMIs (Amazon Machine Images), and scaling policies.
- **Self-Managed Nodes**: For self-managed node groups, CloudFormation can define the necessary Auto Scaling groups, launch configurations, and other related resources.

### 3. **Networking Configuration**

- **VPC and Subnets**: CloudFormation templates can define the VPC, public and private subnets, NAT gateways, and route tables required for the EKS cluster.
- **Security Groups and IAM Roles**: Security configurations, such as security groups and IAM roles/policies required for the EKS cluster and its nodes, can be defined and managed through CloudFormation.

### 4. **Add-on and Resource Deployment**

- **Kubernetes Add-ons**: While Kubernetes add-ons like the AWS Load Balancer Controller, Cluster Autoscaler, and Fluent Bit can be deployed using `kubectl`, CloudFormation can automate their deployment by using AWS service integrations or custom resources.
- **External Resources**: Any AWS resources that need to interact with the EKS cluster, such as S3 buckets for storage, RDS databases, or SNS topics for notifications, can be defined and managed through CloudFormation templates.

### 5. **Updates and Scaling**

- **Rolling Updates**: CloudFormation supports rolling updates, which can be used to apply changes to the EKS cluster infrastructure or node groups without significant downtime.
- **Scaling Policies**: CloudFormation can define scaling policies for the node groups, enabling automatic scaling of resources based on demand.

### 6. **Monitoring and Logging**

- **CloudWatch Integration**: CloudFormation templates can include configurations for integrating EKS with CloudWatch for monitoring and logging. This can include setting up log groups, metrics, and alarms.

### Example of CloudFormation Template for EKS

Here's a simple example of what a CloudFormation template for an EKS cluster might look like:

```yaml
Resources:
  EKSCluster:
    Type: "AWS::EKS::Cluster"
    Properties:
      Name: "my-eks-cluster"
      RoleArn: !GetAtt EKSRole.Arn
      ResourcesVpcConfig:
        SubnetIds:
          - !Ref PublicSubnet
          - !Ref PrivateSubnet
        SecurityGroupIds:
          - !Ref EKSSecurityGroup

  EKSRole:
    Type: "AWS::IAM::Role"
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: "Allow"
            Principal:
              Service: "eks.amazonaws.com"
            Action: "sts:AssumeRole"
      ManagedPolicyArns:
        - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSClusterPolicy"
        - "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKSServicePolicy"

  PublicSubnet:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Subnet"
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
      CidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/24"
      AvailabilityZone: "us-west-2a"
  
  PrivateSubnet:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::Subnet"
    Properties:
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
      CidrBlock: "10.0.1.0/24"
      AvailabilityZone: "us-west-2a"

  VPC:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::VPC"
    Properties:
      CidrBlock: "10.0.0.0/16"

  EKSSecurityGroup:
    Type: "AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup"
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: "EKS cluster security group"
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
```

### Summary
AWS CloudFormation simplifies and automates the provisioning, updating, and management of EKS clusters and their associated resources. It ensures consistency, repeatability, and version control of the infrastructure, thus enhancing operational efficiency and reducing the risk of manual errors.
